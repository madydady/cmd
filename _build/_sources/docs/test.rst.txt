Introduction
============

Review of the TMS/X functionality
---------------------------------

The TMS/X application is used in order to prepare and send cash
operations to the RTGS and ACH for processing.

The TMS/X also allows users to monitor:

-  processing of transactions and requests, have been sent to the
   Central node,

-  reports on transactions and message exchange;

-  other information, related to the bank operations.

Workstation requirements and settings
-------------------------------------

Workstation requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before starting to work with the Web interface system, make sure that
your computer has been installed Microsoft Internet Explorer 10.0 or
higher. The Java script should be enabled in web-browser settings. A
client PC should have at least 512 MB of RAM and at least 1 GB free
space on a hard drive.

Browser proxy-server settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you operate via a proxy-server, find out its address and the port
number from your system administrator. Set the received information in
the correspondent fields of the IE “Tools” - “Internet Options” window
("Connection" – "LAN Settings" – "Proxy server"). If the proxy server
will not be used, then no additional settings are required.

ActiveX component installing and setting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No special installation procedures are required at the participant’s
site, but **when a user connects to the system the first time, the user
should allow installing ActiveX component** (in case user is going to
sign and send transactions via TMS/X GUI manually). Web interface
workplace is built on thin technologies and uses the standard browser
for viewing its GUI.

To run genuine Windows validation, you have to install an ActiveX
control. The Internet Explorer might not be configured to download
ActiveX controls for security reasons, or you might have declined to
install the ActiveX control when the Internet Explorer prompted you to
download, install, or run the control. Do the following actions:

-  Open the Internet Explorer;

-  Click the **Tools** menu, and then click the **Internet Options**;

-  On the ‘Security’ tab (trusted sites), click the Custom level button;

-  Scroll down the Security Settings list until you see the ‘ActiveX
   controls and plug-ins’;

-  For Automatic prompting for the ActiveX controls, click Enable;

-  Scroll down to the ‘Download signed ActiveX controls’ and click
   Enable or Prompt;

-  Scroll down to the ‘Run ActiveX controls and plug-ins’ and click the
   Enable or Prompt;

-  Scroll down to the ‘Script ActiveX controls, marked safe for
   scripting’ and click the Enable or Prompt;

-  Click the OK button and then click the OK again. (You may need to
   restart your computer.).

Adding to Trusted Sites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add the URL
`https://<server>:<port>/portal/ <https://localhost:8743/portal/>`__ to
trusted sites, where:

-  <port> - TCP port for SSL connection to the TMS/X;

-  <server> - name or ip address of the TMS/X server.

To do this, follow the steps:

-  In the Internet Explorer, click **Tools > Internet Options**, and
   then click the ‘Security’ tab;

-  In the ’Select a Web content’ zone s box, click **Trusted Sites** >
   **Sites** to specify its current security setting;

-  In the ‘Add this Web site to the zone’ box, type the URL of the TMS/X
   site, and then click the Add button

Click the OK button two times to accept the changes and return to the
Internet Explorer.

Using only TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you have to only use the TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2, make the following
setting:

-  Left-click the gear icon;

-  Select “Internet options” from the dropdown menu;

-  Click the “Advanced” tab, scroll down and deselect “SSL 2.0” “SSL
   3.0” and “TLS 1.0”;

-  Select “TLS 1.1” and “TLS 1.2”;

-  Click the OK button to accept your changes (it should take effect
   immediately, but you may need to refresh your browser).

Disable compatibility view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you are using the IE 11version:

-  Press the ‘Alt’ key on your keyboard, this will make a menu bar
   appear;

-  Click on the **Tools** menu tab;

-  Select the **Compatibility View settings** option;

-  Uncheck the "Display intranet sites in Compatibility View" option.

Starting the TMS/X application
------------------------------

The workplace is accessible via a standard link in a web-browser address
line (the URL-address depends on the system’s configuration and shall be
issued by the system administrator):

**http://<hostname>:<port>/portal**

where:

-  <hostname> - a name or IP address of the host, where the web server
   is installed;

-  <port> is a port number.

Example 1: https://prism-client:8080/portal

Example 2: https://10.1.28.164:8080/portal

In order to launch the TMS/X application, call up the Microsoft Internet
Explorer, specify the URL-address of the program and then click the
"Enter" key:

|image0|

A login form will be displayed:

|image1|

Each user shall be assigned a unique login and password for a
registration on the TMS/X server (this is provided by the system
administrator). Fill in fields of the form by your credentials and press
the Sign in button. After the entered data was successfully verified,
the user will get access to available options of the system, according
to his(her) role, and the starting page will be opened:

|image2|

Connect to the TMS/X
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to close a communication session for the current user, click
the username in the header of the TMS/X window and choose the ‘Logout’
command from the drop down menu:

|image3|

A login form will pop up again, where you can enter another user’s login
and password (e.g., to make authorization actions that were unavailable
for the previously connected user).

The TMS/X server may interrupt current user connection due to some
situations (e.g., in the case of long period of yours inactivity). In
such cases, the TMS/X page will be blanked and the alert will pop up:

|image4|

Try to login once more and in the case of a failure, contact to the
system administrator or supporting team.

User Role Hierarchy and Allocation 
-----------------------------------

The TMS/X Workplace supports the following allocation of the user roles
(each role defines set of access rights (permissions) to monitoring data
and making operations):

-  System Administrator – gives the permission to dictionaries,
   authorization profiles and switchover management;

-  Security administrator – gives the permission to create user access
   and authorities’ management tasks;

-  Security officer – gives the permission to approve user access and
   authorities’ management tasks;

-  Operator – gives the permission create, edit and make transactions
   and transaction requests;

-  Controller – gives the permission to authorize transaction and
   transaction requests.

The TMS/X administrator may assign one or several roles from the list to
any user.

Each of the TMS/X users connects to the TMS/X by using his own login and
password. After the user is connected, the TMS/X identifies the user’s
role(s), which are definitely associated with the user credentials in
the system. The contents of the TMS/X pages and menus will correspond to
the identified user role.

Summary of the TMS/X interface
==============================

Working page organization
-------------------------

The application screen of the TMS/X consists of the following main
elements:

|image5|

-  Logo and horizontal main menu bar at the header;

-  Screen body that usually reflects currently opened table or object
   detail form;

-  Information bar that is located in the footer

The TMS/X main menu
-------------------

The TMS/X main menu is a horizontal bar at the top of the application
page. The main menu contains top-level items that correspond to separate
application’s sections. The top-level items may contain sub-items that
are opened automatically, when you click the parent menu item. Each
sub-item itself may contain one or few sub-items, etc. (multi-level
hierarchy):

|image6|

The user’s main menu contains the following submenus:

-  **TMS/X** – closes currently opened page and returns to the home
   blank page;

-  **Capture** – allows users to create a new operation (instruction) of
   selected type. See the section 0 below for details;

-  **Monitoring** – allows users to monitor base objects and operations
   (such as transactions and messages) registered in the Central node
   system. See the section 3.3.2 below for details;

-  **Dictionary** - displays dictionaries of correspondents, accounts,
   operation types and other accessory data that are used in payment
   preparation and processing. Operators can view, and Administrators
   can manage the dictionaries. See the section 3.2 below for details;

-  **Reports** – allows users to view and print custom reports on
   monitoring transactions and user activity. See the section 3.5 below;

-  **User tools** (shown as the user name’s icon with a drop down menu
   |image7|) – allows user to login on/off and change their password
   (See the section 3.1 below for details). Also displays the user login
   information.

    |C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1bcb1e9.PNG|

    |C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML16d81f2.PNG|

The TMS/X tables
----------------

TMS/X table layout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following interface elements present in the TMS/X tables
(dependently on the table data, some of them may be absent in a concrete
table):

|image12|

-  A name of the opened table,

-  The table’s toolbar with the buttons for calling actions, which will
   affect the table or manipulate its record. The toolbar is placed just
   above the table. The number of buttons may be various for specific
   tables (some buttons may absent in some tables). Typical actions are:

    |image13| - refreshes the table data (some tables (Transactions,
    Sustem events, etc.) are refreshed automatically and user can
    refresh other tables manually anytime via pressing the button);

    |image14| - adds a new record into the table (correspondent entry
    form will be opened in a separate window);

    |image15|- pops up a context menu (see the description of its items
    in sections 2.4.2, 2.8 and 2.7 below):

    |C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML846440.PNG|

    |image17|- closes the table and returns to the home page of the
    TMS/X.

The row local toolbar with icons of actions, which only affect the
record, may be displayed in the last column of the table:

|image18|

Description of such actions will be given in sections, referred to
concrete tables.

-  Line of table header contains a set of descriptive names of the
   table's columns. You can sort the table's data in both ascending and
   descending order. Use the down-arrow icon, which becomes visible when
   the mouse pointer is over a column name: |image19|. You can also sort
   the table by the column's data by simply clicking on a column header.
   When the table is sorted by the column's data, it is indicated by an
   up-arrow (|image20|) or down-arrow (|image21|) in the column header.

-  The selected line is highlighted with a light grey color in the
   table.

-  When the screen window cannot hold the entire table, the scrollbar(s)
   will be displayed to make table data scrolling available.

-  Use the Search field for fast searching records in large tables. Type
   any fragment of value, which you intend to find among the table
   records, in the field. The table will immediately be filtered, so
   that the records, containing the specified fragment in their columns,
   will only remain:

|image22|

To return to the full table, just clear the Search field.

Displaying/hiding table's columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can display or hide any table column, depending on what information
is more important. Call the table context menu and press the Column
visibility button from there:

|C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTMLef9a6f.PNG|

A list of the table column’s names will drop down:

|image24|

Click the column names in the list, which are not to be displayed (their
background color will change from blue to white):

|C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTMLf79a11.PNG|

Selected columns will immediately abandon the table:

|image26|

To return the hidden columns into the table, call the ‘Column
visibility’ option again and click the names of the hidden columns once
more (their background color will change to blue):

|C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTMLf79a11.PNG| |image28|

Selected columns will immediately appear in the table.

Filters in tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can apply filtering to the data, displayed in the most of the
tables. When the filtering options are available, the filter bar is
placed above the table. To set the filter, click the bar. Fill in the
necessary fields in the pop-up filter dialog box, then press the Filter
button inside:

|image29|

The table will be updated, so that only the records, which meet the
criteria, will remain. If filter field is a list, you can specify any
numbers of possible values from it in some filters:

|image30|

The content of the filter depends on the table’s matter.

Viewing/editing table record details 
-------------------------------------

If the row record in the opened table has one or more fields that are
colored in blue, it means that you can view or edit the data from the
record in a separate form by simply clicking the hyperlink:

|image31|

A special multi-tab form with details of the record will pop-up, where
you can view or edit them:

|image32|

Printing table data
-------------------

To print the content of any table, call the table context menu and press
the Print button from there.

The printing page layout and standard printer manager dialog box will be
shown in a separate window. Make settings there and press its own Print
button to send the page to the selected printer.

Copying table data
------------------

To copy a content of any table into a clipboard, call the table context
menu and press the Copy button from there. The information message will
be shown:

|image33|

Then you can paste the clipboard content into any textual editor or
other application, supporting OLE-technology

Exporting table data
--------------------

To convert the content of any table to the MS Excel file, call the table
context menu and press the Excel button from there:

|C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1e24092.PNG|

Confirm the operation in the pop up message box by pressing the Open or
Save button inside it. The name of the file will be generated
automatically, but you can change it by choosing the Save As option
instead of the Save.

Specify new file name and location and press the Save button in the
pop-up standard dialog box.

The table data will be opened or saved in the correspondent
application’s format:

|C:\\Users\\sazonov\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\SNAGHTML1f2214f.PNG|

Then you can edit the file by using standard tools of the application
(e.g., in order to prepare a report).

*Note:* I\ *n the case a filtering was applied to the table, the
filtered data will only be exported, but not the whole table.*

Main tables and actions
=======================

User session operations
-----------------------

The login form appears on the screen automatically every time the TMS/X
is started (see the section 1.3.1). When the user is logged-on, the
following session operations are available from the separate menu that
will pop-up, as the user clicks its name in the TMS/X main menu:

|image36|

The Session menu contains the following items:

-  **Logout** — logs off the user from the TMS/X and suggest new
   session;

-  **Change password** — allows changing user's password (availability
   of the item depends on whether this functionality is provided in the
   current version of the software and cryptography settings).

Logging out 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process of logging out of the software just invokes the logout
function and redirects you to the login page, where you can enter
credential of another user (e.g., in order to make an authorization of
entered payment).

Changing own user password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changing user’s password might be disabled depending on user's
permissions and cryptographic methods that are used in the current
version of the TMS/X.

When this option is able, call the **Session** > **Change password**
menu item. The dialog form will open:

|image37|

To change the password, type in your old password, the new one and
retype the new password once again, in the correspondent fields of the
form. The new password should be complex enough (from a security
viewpoint); otherwise, the TMS/X wouldn't accept it. Then press the
Change button to confirm the action. In the case of mistake, the error
message will be issued:

|image38|

Close the message box and try to fill in the fields of the password
changing form correctly. In case of success, you will immediately be
redirected to the login page. Enter your login and **new** password, as
usual:

|image39|

After successful connection, the TMS/X will inform you about new
password’s validity term:

|image40|

values; you can correct them if it is necessary.

If the value is disabled for editing, it is displayed as faded to gray.

Mandatory fields of any form are marked with red asterisks \* in front
of their names:

    |image53|

You can’t save an instruction, if at least one of the mandatory fields
is empty or incorrect (see the section 3.3.1.2).

Most of the fields on any forms are lists. To get the whole list for a
choice, click the symbol at the end of the field:

|image54|

Processing transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Authorization: basic principles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Authorization in the TMS/X can be applied to a particular type of
documents. The authorization itself is a procedure that assumes
specified actions from user(s), other than the user, who created the
document. Dependently on settings, which are provided by the TMS/X
Administrator (described in the separate TMS/X Administrator Guide,
supplied by the CMA), the authorization procedure may be either applied
or not to the particular documents (or their types) and its rules may
flexibly be changed.

All the authorization actions are made by approvers. An approver in the
TMS/X is a person (user) who has an authority to authenticate and/or
change the document. To be an approver, such user(s) must own at least
one of the corresponded roles that is also managed by the TMS/X
Administrator.

Making authorization actions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the document is issued by user-maker and saved in the TMS/X local
database, the TMS/X tries to pick up an authorization profile, which
would be applied to the document (based on appropriate settings, have
been done by the Administrator). In the case the profile is found, local
status of the document changes from “Created” to “Waiting for
Authorization”, and users-approvers can make the following authorization
actions:

-  Approve the document. The Approver checks the document attributes via
       popping up the view form and calls the ‘Approve’ command,
       provided (s)he didn’t notice any kind of mistakes. The document
       will move to the next processing step (is ready to be sent);

-  Decline the document. In the case any errors were found, the Approver
       user calls the ‘Decline’ command. The document will move back to
       the previous step for repairing.

The both actions are logged in the document processing audit.
