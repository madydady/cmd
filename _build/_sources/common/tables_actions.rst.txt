User session operations
========================

The login form appears on the screen automatically every time the TMS/X
is started (see the section Ошибка: источник перекрёстной ссылки не
найден). When the user is logged-on, the following session operations
are available from the separate menu that will pop-up, as the user
clicks its name in the TMS/X main menu:

|image0|

The Session menu contains the following items:

-  **Logout** — logs off the user from the TMS/X and suggest new
   session;

-  **Change password** — allows changing user's password (availability
   of the item depends on whether this functionality is provided in the
   current version of the software and cryptography settings).

.. rubric:: Logging out

The process of logging out of the software just invokes the logout
function and redirects you to the login page, where you can enter
credential of another user (e.g., in order to make an authorization of
entered payment).

.. rubric:: Changing own user password

Changing user’s password might be disabled depending on user's
permissions and cryptographic methods that are used in the current
version of the TMS/X.

When this option is able, call the **Session** > **Change password**
menu item. The dialog form will open:

|image1|

To change the password, type in your old password, the new one and
retype the new password once again, in the correspondent fields of the
form. The new password should be complex enough (from a security
viewpoint); otherwise, the TMS/X wouldn't accept it. Then press the
Change button to confirm the action. In the case of mistake, the error
message will be issued:

|image2|

Close the message box and try to fill in the fields of the password
changing form correctly. In case of success, you will immediately be
redirected to the login page. Enter your login and **new** password, as
usual:

|image3|

After successful connection, the TMS/X will inform you about new
password’s validity term:
